# Weather Forecasting

Job is to write a function that can take seven days of data and make predictions with no additional context.

Your only job is to replace the function predict_dst in benchmark/predict.py with logic that will take seven days worth of data (see the docstring) and output two predictions: one for the current hour (t0) and one for the next hour. See the extensive description on the code submission page.
